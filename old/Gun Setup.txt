packet timeout -> max time to begin a new packet (> 2*pulse width * packet length)
pulse width -> width of IR pulses and minimum time between IR pulses (i.e. time between pulses is 2*pulsewidth)

Recieving hits

	Pin interrupt on pin 2 (head) and 3 (body)
		On RISING_EDGE
		Record time since last pulse
		Start new packet if time > timeout
		Else add to packet
		Store packet into a block array, so more than one packet can be waiting to be processed at once
	
Firing

	No interupt, loop body sets a setFire flag
	
	timer interrupt with period pulse delay -> toggles 38KHz timer
	

PulseWidth timer

	Will cycle through a packet, enabling and disabling the 38KHz timer
	
38kHz timer
	
	Variable controls 0 (no fire), 1 (fire 1), 2 (fire 2), and 3(fire 12)
	If Enabled, altrenates the Firing LEDs at 38KHz
	
Main loop:
	process hit events
	check buttons and set firing flags
	send serial messages
	Write to display
	(Not necessarily in that order)
